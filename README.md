##PTBoatBattle
### Team VFW (AKA Team 4) Mini-Project 

### Overview
- This is a variation of Sink My Battleship
- Text based and with small PT boats
- Written only in Java
- Currently, with no GUI front-end
- Designed to be expanded later with features added

### How to run
- Starting the game takes the user to a command prompt that takes in the users name and provides a text based picture of the
battlefield
- User enters their name, and then following directions enters 5 coordinates for their boats to be added to the
field.  Immediately afterwards the computer picks 5 places at random, not selected by the user
and places its pieces.
- The game then begins with the user entering coordinates for a shot to try and hit the computers pieces.
- The computer then takes random a shot after each user.
- The game is designed, so that the computer and user will never be on the same square.
- It is also designed to ensure a shot fired is not a duplicate of  previously taken shots.
- The game ends when one of the opponets has no more pieces on the gameboard.

#### Symbology used
